<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 18 year old indian girl who is really curious just like her name meant Jigyasa which means curiousity in english.
I'll gonna join college this year only for engineering from IIT.I"m heartly thankful to you to come as far to look into
this.To my surpise I'm currently just learning web development to pass my time as there is some sort of time while 
councelling is going on.
</p>

<p>Just little about my academics,I have completed my high school with 10 CGPA and my higher secondary with 9.5 CGPA.
I'm just an average student which look into things in a little different way from Today's generation.I was always been a talkative
person by after this jee journey now I'm an introvert and from my point of view every behaviour has it's own pros and cons.
</p>

<p>I'm little excited and at the same time little scared for my upcoming college journey.
This is it I guess<br />
Thanks for reading.
